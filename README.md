It's a shame you know. During a train ride, regarding two gypsys grils. I had the chance to them! Alas, I  approached around lunch, but it obviously wasn't in the cards. Keeping my eye trained, things were certain as I watched the gypsys girl and her daughter moving to that place in the train where people jumping off per routine. At this point, I had lost my original train of thought; both the soles of the womans' feet and her daughter were black, leaving "feet prints" too easy to notie! Cute it in quiant way, but I would glady have furnished them at least a fine pair of shoes to wear around village/town! Not mention a nice dinner, had they stck around..

THAT is about the gist of it! It took me 4 efforrts to write that little memory. Each time with more than 5 typos. Feet and trains it is.
