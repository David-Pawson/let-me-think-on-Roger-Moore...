It's a shame you know. During a train ride, regarding two gypsys grils. I had the chance to mee! Alas, I  approached around lunch, but it obviously wasn't in the cards. Keeping my eye trained, things were certain as I watched the gypsys girl and her daughter move to that place in the train where they jumping off is routine. At this point, I had lost my original train of thought; both the soles of the womans' feet and her daughter were black, leaving "feet prints" too easy to notie! Cute it in quiant way, but I would glady have furnished the at least a fine shoe to wear around village/town! had they stck around.

THAT is about the gist of it! It took me 4 efforrts to write his ans NOT one told the same story. So feet and trains it is.
